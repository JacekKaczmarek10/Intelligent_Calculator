This program has got one class called Calculator. 
This class has got a few methods. 

menu methods is simple instruction.

inputAmount methods has got java exception inside in order to check if user inserted correct value.
So if user inserts something different from type Double (e.g "cat") then he needs to insert something again, till 
user inserts correct value(e.g 5.3).

inputAction method loads char value and then checks if user inserted correct char value.
Then this method returns char type if it was correct. In another case user needs to insert value again
till he inserts char type value. Only correct char values are (+,-,*,/).

equation metod returns result depended of what user wanted to calculate.

go methods is a condition that decides if program needs to be continued.
